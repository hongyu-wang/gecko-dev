#Diagnosis
From the mozilla website: https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/how-to-block-fingerprinting-with-firefox/, fingerprinting is a feature from advertisers that will allow the advertiser to present targeted ads to the user.

The issue described in the bugzilla bug is several utility functions in the nsContentUtils.cpp will return false when a nullptr is passed into the function. This may allow some websites to bypass fingerprinting if they determine how to pass a nullptr into these functions, regardless of the settings that the user chose. 

There is very little risk to this change since it is unlikely that a nullptr will be passed into these functions in the first place. Additionally the fix will default to another function's expected behavior with no new logic implemented.

#Solution
The solution, as outlined in the bugzilla bug, is to have all sections instead return ```StaticPrefs::privacy_resistFingerprinting()``` rather than ```false```.

#Testing Document
Testing is done by making sure .```/mach build``` builds successfully locally and ```./mach test all``` executes with no errors.
